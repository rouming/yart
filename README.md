# YART
YART is a just Yet Another Ray Tracing renderer boosted by OpenCL
based on lessons from http://scratchapixel.com and http://pbr-book.org

The main goal is nothing but to learn ray tracing algorithms and implement
C code which can be compiled on host and simultaneously compiled and loaded
by OpenCL framework.
